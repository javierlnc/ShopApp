## Projecto FullStack, usando angular 18 y Spring Boot

This project is created using Angular 18 and Spring Boot. This repository stores both parts of the code. The idea is to start by creating microservices for different parts of the backend, along with unit tests and integration tests.

## Microservices

- Product Service
- Order Service
- Inventory Service
- Notification Service

## Docker

I use Docker to create the environments with the database. In this project, I used a MongoDB database for the product service and two MySQL databases for the inventory and order services, both configured in the Docker Compose file."
